# we have a larger project, 
## Description 
it makes sense that collaborators follow a certain path to create a pull request.
For this reason, we can create a PR template. We'll do that in this demo where we'll use this template to create a pull request.
Now the pull requests we have created so far were not the best examples of how a good pull request should be created. 
It could definitely be adding more useful information to it. It's
better to create a template so that contributors will always be creating a pull request in a certainformat. 
We can create multiple templates for pull requests. We'll create just one here. Now in order for it to be recognized as a pull request template,
the pull request template needs to have a certain name. So we'll create one directly to through the GitHub interface, and I'll do that as part of a new commit.
So I'll create a new file here. And in order for it to be recognized, the file name should be pull_request_template.md, and I'm going to create it directly in the root.
As we have already seen, pull request templates are also created in Markdown. There we go.
We can use Markdown to create that template. In the template, I ask that pull request creators do enter a description, as well as an indication of the type of changes.
Is it a bug, is the feature, and so on. If we look at the preview, this is how it will be rendered. People are asked for a description, and they can indicate the type
of change. Let's commit this directly to the main branch. So now we see here that the pull_request_template is now indeed in our branch as a regular file. If we now 
create a new pull request, indeed, I will get this template to fill in. This is the information that the contributors expect from me as a creator of a pull request. 
So I need to enter the description and also indicate what type of change I'm suggesting.
